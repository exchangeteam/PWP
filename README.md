# Database setup
## Required librarys
The project of database requires `Flask`, `flask_sqlalchemy`, `sqlite3`. All of these can be installed by using `pip install` command with the name, like `pip install Flsk`.
## Creating the database
Tha data base can be created by running two lines of code: 
```python
from database import db
db.create_all()
```
Then an empty database named `test.db` is in the same directory where your code is.
## Populating the database

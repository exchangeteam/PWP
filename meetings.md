# Meetings notes

## Meeting 1.
* **DATE: 11.02.2019**
* **ASSISTANTS: Iv치n S치nchez Milara**
* **GRADE:** *To be filled by course staff*

### Minutes
 - The meeting took about 20 minutes.
 - The teacher guided us on our faulty parts. He was vey helpful pointing which parts we need to fix.

### Action points
 - In the first question of deadline,
 	- There is a function called 'Data Push and Collection'. This function is ambigious and does not tell what it does.
 	- Also, there are some parts concerning a website. This deadline and application is about an API, we should not mention any website. We should only think on the API.
 - In the second question of deadline,
 	- There are some parts concerning a possible GUI. Again, designin a GUI is not a part of what we do.
 	- An answer box should have only one type of answer, and it should be string.
 	- Statistics are too much detailed. This makes things harder. We should only return answers as statistics. The further calculations can be implemented as extra work.
 	- User authentication, login and registration makes things more complicated. Those features should be removed. The further implementation can be done as extra work.
 	- A question should have an answer resource.
 - In the third question of deadline,
 	- There is a function called 'Automatic Scoring'. This is not a function of our API. It can be implemented using an external service as extra work.
 - In the fourth question of deadline,
 	- There is an example taken and translated from the internet, there should be a reference to this information.
 	- The classification of the API is missing.
 	- Also, there should be a better example of API usage.
 - In general,
 	- In all the deadlines, there is an estimated hours section. We should use this as how much time we spent in hours, not to put deadlines.

## Meeting 2.
* **DATE: 26.02.2019**
* **ASSISTANTS: Iv치n S치nchez Milara**
* **GRADE:** *To be filled by course staff*

### Minutes
 - The meeting took about 30 minutes.
 - The teacher made some suggestions to make the application more usable.
 - The teacher had some suggesetions on creating new details in the application.

### Action points
 - In the first question of deadline (Database Design),
    - We need to create a table which will hold some sort of session log. We can call this table questionnaire-instance or session.
    - This table will be used for retrieving the answers from one person. Otherwise, it is not clear which answer belongs to which user.
    - This table should basically include questionnaire-id and answer-id.
    - Also, in question table, attribute 'Title' looks a bit ambigious. We could rename it, but this is not mandatory.

 - In the third question of deadline (Database Testing),
    - We also need testing in an edge case. We can try testing to break nullable attributes.

 - In general,
    - The documentation in both wiki and in the project is neat and enough. We have good documentation in the application.
    - Meeting notes are hold clear and good.
    - We need to mention the usage of sqlite in README file.
    - Also, the SQL dump is missing. It should be added to the repository.
